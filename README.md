# OCR Discipline and Attendance Visualization Tool
Certain Washington State schools have had consistent issues with disproportionate discipline rates and chronic absenteeism rates for certain minority demographics. Currently, Washington State can only identify these schools after school districts submit attendance and discipline data to the Federal Office of Civil Rights (OCR).

The state would like to be more proactive in identifying the schools and districts that may not meet federal requirements in order to preemptively check that data has been entered correctly and provide more immediate assistance to specifics districts, as necessary.

For a given district, this tool creates a summary report for each school in that district which covers discipline and attendance records for select student demographics. Demographics with disproportionately high absenteeism or discipline rates are highlighted. The report can be used to quickly highlight areas that need further investigation.

## Running the Tool
### Input
The tool takes a .csv file expected to follow the [standardized format](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2013-14-flat-file-submission-instructions.doc) defined by the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).
### Output

## State of the Project
Create a proof-of-concept report showing the potential results of such a tool. Further iteration on the project might include investigation of absenteeism and discipline on a grade-by-grade basis, and review of variables outside of absenteeism/discipline, but extensions will then depend on the needs of the client
