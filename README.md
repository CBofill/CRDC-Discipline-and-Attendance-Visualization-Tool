# OCR Discipline and Attendance Visualization Tool
Washington State has had consistent issues with disproportionate discipline rates and chronic absenteeism rates 
for certain demographics. Identifying the schools and districts that are struggling with these issues, and providing 
assistance, is imperative to providing equitable educational opportunity.
This tool creates a report of a school district's discipline and attendance records which presents the data based 
on student demographics, with disproportionate rates highlighted. The report can be used to quickly find problem 
areas for further investigation.

## Running the Tool
